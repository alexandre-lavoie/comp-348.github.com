#+TITLE: Setting up your Lisp environment

* Question

There is several different environments that you can use for writing Common Lisp code, in this
guide you will pick an environment and learn to set it up.

For Common Lisp, you can use either an online text-editor or an IDE locally on your computer. While
the Swish-Prolog environment works great for Prolog, the online editors for Lisp don't really meet
the same standard. If you'd like and you don't want to bother with setting up a local environment,
then you can use either the [[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_lisp_online.php][tutorialspoint.com]] editor or [[https://rextester.com/l/common_lisp_online_compiler][rextester]].

If you'd like to set up a local environment, then you can follow down below.
